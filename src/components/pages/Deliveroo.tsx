      New riders feel unprepared to begin riding due to all the unknowns and they are
      also concerned about what the order experience looks like. This has resulted in
      many new riders not turning up to their first shift, in our Singapore market
      25% of new riders are not activating. Activation is defined as completing the
      first 10 orders. <br />
      <br />
      In order to feel prepared and reduce anxiety, applicants source further
      information from their rider friends and the rider trainers at the onboarding
      centre.{" "}

      There is a bigger goal to signing up all remote, and reduce in person

      education needs to work remotely.{" "}

     <div className="text-4xl font-medium">Research</div>
     <div className="">
      <div className="">
       We went to onboarding centers to conduct user research by speaking to people
       who have just signed up to work. From the research we have learned that these
       are the most important questions we need to solve for:
      </div>
      <br />
      <ul className="list-disc left-10 relative">
       <li>How do I book a session?</li>
       <li>
        Where do I go to work?- New riders donâ€™t understand where to go to receive
        orders.
       </li>
       <li>
        I cannot visualise an order - what will it look like?- Riders are anxious
        about what they are expected to do to successfully complete and order through
        the app.
       </li>
       <li>What do I do when something goes wrong on an order?</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
       We started by auditing the current videos in the onboarding process to
       understand the information we are currently communicating and why new riders
       still felt unprepared. We realised that riders are shown this information
       before they complete the application forms. For them this is too early in the
       process. At that point they need information regarding pay and working hours.
       The videos could not be accessed after this point so riders are not able to
       refer back to them when they are ready to work.

     <div className="text-4xl font-medium">Activation flow</div>
     <div className="">
      The flow shows the journey from the application being approved to the first
      order being completed. The numbered points show in order where we experience
      the biggest drop off from data. The highest one occurs after riders have booked
      a session, they become anxious about what the delivery experience will actually
      be like. We Our original assumptions were that the booking tool in the app was
      too difficult to use.

     <div className="text-4xl font-medium">Design concepts</div>
     <div className="">
      We learnt from research that the booking tool was very easy to understand, the
      main concerns were around being anxious of what the order experience was going
      to be like. Receiving the order in the app, going to the restaurant and
      delivering to the customer. <br />
      <br />
      As the new onboarding system will take a few months to build, we plan to solve
      this problem using <strong>emails</strong> and the rider blog website. These
      are the modules for each topic.

     <div className="text-4xl font-medium">Testing</div>
     <div className="">
      We tested the modules as emails at an onboarding center with newly approved
      riders. Even though the new riders had just seen this information during the
      application process, they liked the idea of being able to go back to the
      information to refresh their minds before their first session. <br />
      <br />
      The final design was made up of 2 emails that the rider received before booking
      a session and after booking one. The content in the first email is designed to
      encourage riders to book a session by outlining the steps of delivering an
      order and giving them directions of how to decide where to work. <br />
      <br />
      Once they have booked a session a second email is triggered containing more
      detailed information about what to expect on the first session and directing
      them where the best place to wait for an order.{" "}

     <div className="text-4xl font-medium">Outcome</div>
     <div className="">
      We ran a test in Singapore and the UK for 2 weeks, and we saw a slight increase
      in activation, by 12%. The open rate of the emails was not as high as we
      expected. From previous conversations with new riders, we believe this could be
      due to the amount emails they receive in the current onboarding system. Riders
      have expressed how annoying they find these emails, this will be different in
      the new onboarding system that is being built as everything will be done within
      the website. With the results we have seen we expect activation to increase
      over time as we have been able to identify the information the riders were
      lacking.
